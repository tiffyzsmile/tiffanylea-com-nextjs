      '<b>Completely revised and updated, this best-selling introduction to programming in JavaScript focuses on writing real applications.</b><br /><br /><i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> dives into the JavaScript language to show programmers how to write elegant, effective JavaScript code. Like any good programming book, <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> begins with fundamentals--variables, control structures, functions, and data structures--then moves on to complex topics like object-oriented programming and regular expressions. This third edition introduces new features covering the 2017 version of JavaScript, such as class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and black scope. Author Marijn Haverbeke keeps the friendly tone and easy-to-follow explanations that made the original a hit, and he adds new exercises for readers to test their skills. <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> will have readers fluent in the language of the web in no time, eloquently.',

    book_description:
      'Are you ready to create your own "good charts"--data visualizations that more effectively communicate your ideas and research and that advance your career? The original <i>Good Charts</i> has changed the dataviz and management landscape by helping readers understand how to think visually, and by laying out a process for creating powerful data visualizations.<br /><br />Since its publication, the market has consistently demanded more practical content and tools to help people in all kinds of enterprises gain the skills they need to get started. The <i>Good Charts Workbook</i> extends the usefulness of <i>Good Charts</i> by putting theory into practice and helping readers to apply its principles.<br /><br />Author, HBR editor, and dataviz expert Scott Berinato leads you, step-by-step, through several example datasets and basic charts, providing space for users to practice the <i>Good Charts</i> talk-sketch-prototype process for improving those charts. Users are prompted at each step with reminders and hints about how to proceed. Examples will include a "Discussion Key" showing how to approach the challenge and why. Each challenge focuses on a different, common visualization problem such as simplification, storytelling, creating conceptual charts, and many others.<br /><br /><i>Good Charts Workbook</i> is the must-have complement to <i>Good Charts</i>, helping you become more sophisticated in understanding the dataviz around you and more effective in using dataviz to make your case.',

    book_description:
      '<b>Node.js</b> Guidebook aims to introduce readers to the world of Node.js. Node.js is an open source JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript on server-side. Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.<b>Contents</b>Introduction to Node.js, Modules in MNode.js, File System Module, NPM in Node, Event Handling in Node.js, More on Modules, Node.js with My SQL, Express and Node .Js',

    book_description:
      "In this book, you'll find 54 hands-on descriptions that help you DO the key methods used in service design. These methods include instructions, guidelines, and tips-and-tricks for activities within research, ideation, prototyping, and facilitation. This is the print version of the method companion to the book <i>This Is Service Design Doing</i> (#TiSDD). It includes the same content that you can find free on the book website, tisdd.com, but nicely revisualized and presented in a professional bound format.<br /><br />Caveat: While methods are the building blocks of a service design process, owning a pile of bricks does not make you an architect or even a bricklayer. Success in doing service design certainly requires a mastery of these methods. However, you must also be able to combine them into a process that fits the context and needs of your organization and guide people through this new way of working.<br /><br />This book only contains the building blocks--the methods. It doesn't detail how to assemble them into a cohesive design process or how to plan or manage it. Neither does it describe why people should invest in service design nor explain how to bring service design to life in your organization. For all of this (and more), please read <i>This Is Service Design Doing</i>.",

    book_description:
      '<p><em>What “<strong>Kubernetes” </strong>does and how?</em></p><p>After working in the technology and consulting ecosystem for the last 10 years, I am a huge supporter of simplification. While I understood the whole concept of Containerization and automating the deployment, I wanted to explain the bunch of newly recruited Technology Consultants in our team that how actually it’s used and deployed.</p><p>So, the logical topics to be explained with examples were:</p>  The Background of it? Why we needed this system in first place? \n   How Kubernetes Operates? The Nuts and Bolts of the system. \n   How it is deployed? \n   Best Practices \n <p>If these things are clear with examples then we can operate with confidence and manage the project well.</p><p>So, here it is. All our discussions are formulated in a book to help you people to take your respective agenda ahead in your current role with conviction. The book has been written in a simple, easy to comprehend language and can be used by Non-Programmers, Project Managers, Business Consultants or any other persons with an interest in Kubernetes.</p><p>So, move ahead with your Continuous Development journey with this new book and as I mentioned earlier: <strong><em>let’s simplify the discussions around!</em></strong></p>',

    book_description:
      "In this book, the CEO of Cazton, Inc. and internationally-acclaimed speaker, <b>Chander Dhall</b>, demonstrates current website design scalability patterns and takes a pragmatic approach to explaining their pros and cons to show you how to select the appropriate pattern for your site. He then tests the patterns by deliberately forcing them to fail and exposing potential flaws before discussing how to design the optimal pattern to match your scale requirements. The author explains the use of polyglot programming and how to match the right patterns to your business needs. He also details several No-SQL patterns and explains the fundamentals of different paradigms of No-SQL by showing complementary strategies of using them along with relational databases to achieve the best results. He also teaches how to make the scalability pattern work with a real-world microservices pattern. <br />With the proliferation of countless electronic devices and the ever growing number of Internet users, the scalability of websites has become an increasingly important challenge. Scalability, even though highly coveted, may not be so easy to achieve. Think that you can't attain responsiveness along with scalability? Chander Dhall will demonstrate that, in fact, they go hand in hand.<br /><b>What You'll Learn</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Architect and develop applications so that they are easy to scale. <br /><br /><br />Learn different scaling and partitioning options and the combinations. <br /><br /><br />Learn techniques to speed up responsiveness. <br /><br /><br />Deep dive into caching, column-family databases, document databases, search engines and RDBMS. <br /><br /><br />Learn scalability and responsiveness concepts that are usually ignored.<br /><br /><br />Effectively balance scalability, performance, responsiveness, and availability while minimizing downtime.<br /><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br /><br />Executives (CXOs), software architects, developers, and IT Pros<br />",

    book_description:
      "Manage and understand the full capabilities of successful REST development. REST API development is a hot topic in the programming world, but not many resources exist for developers to really understand how you can leverage the advantages.<br /><br />This completely updated second edition provides a brief background on REST and the tools it provides (well known and not so well known), then explains how there is more to REST than just JSON and URLs. You will learn about the maintained modules currently available in the npm community, including Express, Restify, Vatican, and Swagger. Finally you will code an example API from start to finish, using a subset of the tools covered.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Node community is currently flooded with modules; some of them are published once and never updated again - cluttering the entire universe of packages. <em>Pro REST API Development with Node.js</em> shines light into that black hole of modules for the developers trying to create an API. Understand REST API development with Node.js using this book today.<br /><br /><b>What You'll Learn</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Understand how REST and API development mix up with Node.js<br /><br /><br />Create a scalable, technology agnostic, and uniform interface<br />Prepare your services to be consumed by your clients<br /><br /><br />Test and deploy your API<br /><br /><br />Review troubleshooting techniques<br /><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br /><br /><br />Any Node.js developer who wants to fully understand REST API development. <br />Beginner and Intermediate Node.js developers who are looking to fully understand how to create RESTful microservices.",

    book_description:
      'A comprehensive introduction to designing services according to the needs of the customer or participants, this book addresses a new and emerging field of design and the disciplines that feed and result from it.<br /><br />Despite its intrinsic multidisciplinarity, service design is a new specialization of design in its own right. Responding to the challenges of and providing holisitic, creative and innovative solutions to increasingly complex contemporary societies, service design now represents an integrative and advanced culture of design. All over the world new design studios are defining their practice as service design while long established design and innovation consultancies are increasingly embracing service design as a key capacity within their offering.<br /><br />Divided into two parts to allow for specific reader requirements, <i>Service Design</i> starts by focusing on main service design concepts and critical aspects. Part II offers a methodological overview and practical tools for the service design learner, and highlights fundamental capacities the service design student must master. Combined with a number of interviews and case studies from leading service designers, this is a comprehensive, informative exploration of this exciting new area of design.',

    book_description:
      "Key Features   Implement common data structures and the associated algorithms, as well as the context in which they are used. \n   Master existing JavaScript data structures such as array, set and map and learn how to implement new ones such as stacks, linked lists, trees and graphs in ES 8. \n   Develop abstract data types to extend JavaScript into a more flexible and powerful programming language \n  Book Description <p>A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer to utilize resources efficiently. Data structures and algorithms are the base of every solution to any programming problem. With this book you will learn to write complex and powerful code using the latest ES 8 features.</p><p>This book begins by covering basics of the JavaScript language and introducing ECMAScript 8, before gradually moving on to the most important data structures such as array, queue, stack, and linked list. You will gain an in-depth knowledge of how hash tables and set data structure functions, as well as how trees and hash maps can be used to search files in a HD or represent a database. This book is an accessible route deeper into JavaScript. Graphs being one of the most complex data structures you’ll encounter, we’ll also give you a better understanding of why and how graphs are largely used in GPS navigation systems in social networks.</p><p>Toward the end of the book, you’ll discover how all the theories presented by this book can be applied in real-world solutions while working on your own computer networks and Facebook searches.</p> What you will learn   Declare, initialize, add, and remove items from array, stack, and queue. \n   Create and use linked lists, doubly linked lists and circular linked lists. \n   Store unique elements with hash table, dictionaries, and set. \n   Use the binary tree and binary search tree. \n   Get the knack of using algorithms such as DFS (Depth-first Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) for the most complex data structures \n   Sort data structures using a range of algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort. \n   Search elements in data structures using sequential sort and binary search. \n  About the Author <p><b>Loiane Groner</b> has over 10 years of experience in developing enterprise applications. She has worked at multinational companies, such as IBM, and nowadays she works as Software Development Manager at a financial institution, where she manages overseas solutions. Her areas of expertise include Java, Sencha technologies (Ext JS), and hybrid mobile development with PhoneGap and Ionic.</p><p>She is passionate about technology, and she has dedicated herself to spreading knowledge in the software development community through her blog, as a guest speaker in IT conferences, and also as a guest professor in university extension courses.</p><p>While at university, she worked as teacher's assistant for 2 years for the Algorithms, Data Structures, and Computing Theory classes. She represented her university at the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest – Brazilian Finals (South America Regionals) and also worked as Student Delegate of SBC (Brazilian Computing Society). She won a merit award in her Senior year for being one of top three students with better GPAs in the Computer Science department and has also graduated with honors.</p><p>Loiane is also the author of the books Ext JS 4 First Look, Mastering Ext JS, Mastering Ext JS - Second Edition, Sencha Architect App Development, Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms, and JavaScript </p>",

    book_description:
      "For digital content to deliver on its potential, it must be easy to find, shareable, and available for all channels and devices. This requires careful upfront attention to back-end content strategy and its linkages with design and development. However, back-end content strategy is an emerging and complex area of practice with few useful resources for practitioners, and many organizations are struggling to deal with soaring amounts of content. In <b>Designing Future-Friendly Content</b>, Mike Atherton and Carrie Hane introduce a comprehensive, up-to-date content strategy process that starts outside the interface, using research and modeling to build a shared map of a subject before a single pixel is drawn. Their content-first approach helps you reuse and remix valuable assets both for today's needs and tomorrow's opportunities, as you master the interplay of content strategy, design, and management, and smoothly orchestrate your entire content team. Throughout, this practical and conversational guide demonstrates key concepts through case study examples and illustrations. You'll learn how to:<br />Model subject domains and use your models to plan web content Research and model content and use the results to inform UI and CMS design Plan for an effective CMS implementation Clarify the roles of designers, developers, and content strategists, and build cross-functional teams that work together well Tackle content overload, growing device diversity, fast-changing design trends, siloed content creation, and other key challenges",

      'Functional-Light JavaScript is a balanced, pragmatic exploration of Functional Programming in JavaScript. <br /><br />Functional Programming (FP) is an incredibly powerful paradigm for structuring code that yields more robust, verifiable, and readable programs. If you\'ve ever tried to learn FP but struggled with terms like "monad", mathematical concepts like category theory, or symbols like λ, you\'re not alone. <br /><br />Functional-Light programming distills the most vital aspects of FP—function purity, value immutability, composition, and more!—down to approachable JavaScript patterns. Rather than the all-or-nothing dogmatism often encountered in FP, this book teaches you how to improve your programs line by line.',

      "Learn the psychological constrictions of attention, perception, memory, disposition, motivation, and social influence that determine whether customers will be receptive to your digital innovations.<br /><br />Bottlenecks: Aligning UX Design with User Psychology fills a need for entrepreneurs, designers, and marketing professionals in the application of foundational psychology to user-experience design. The first generation of books on the topic focused on web pages and cognitive psychology. This book covers apps, social media, in-car infotainment, and multiplayer video games, and it explores the crucial roles played by behaviorism, development, personality, and social psychology. Author David Evans is an experimental psychology Ph.D. and senior manager of consumer research at Microsoft who recounts high-stakes case studies in which behavioral theory aligned digital designs with the bottlenecks in human nature to the benefit of users and businesses alike.<br /><br />Innovators in design and students of psychology will learn:<br /><br />The psychological processes determining users' perception of, engagement with, and recommendation of digital innovations<br /><br />Examples of interfaces before and after simple psychological alignments that vastly enhanced their effectiveness<br /><br />Strategies for marketing and product development in an age of social media and behavioral targeting<br /><br />Hypotheses for research that both academics and enterprises can perform to better meet users' needs<br /><br />Who This Book Is For<br /><br />Designers and entrepreneurs will use this book to give their innovations an edge on what are increasingly competitive platforms such as apps, bots, in-car apps, augmented reality content. Usability researchers and market researchers will leverage it to enhance their consulting and reporting. Students and lecturers in psychology departments will want it to help land employment in the private sector.",

      'Building upon the success of best-sellers The Clean Coder and Clean Code, legendary software craftsman Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin shows how to bring greater professionalism and discipline to application architecture and design.<br />As with his other books, Martin\'s Clean Architecture doesn\'t merely present multiple choices and options, and say "use your best judgment": it tells you what choices to make, and why those choices are critical to your success. Martin offers direct, no-nonsense answers to key architecture and design questions like:<br /><br />What are the best high level structures for different kinds of applications, including web, database, thick-client, console, and embedded apps?<br /><br />What are the core principles of software architecture?<br /><br />What is the role of the architect, and what is he/she really trying to achieve?<br /><br />What are the core principles of software design?<br /><br />How do designs and architectures go wrong, and what can you do about it?<br /><br />What are the disciplines and practices of professional architects and designers?<br /><br />Clean Architecture is essential reading for every software architect, systems analyst, system designer, and software manager -- and for any programmer who aspires to these roles or is impacted by their work.',

    book_description:
      '<b>An engaging, illustrated collection of insights revealing the practices and principles that expert software designers use to create great software.</b><br /><br />What makes an expert software designer? It is more than experience or innate ability. Expert software designers have specific habits, learned practices, and observed principles that they apply deliberately during their design work. This book offers sixty-six insights, distilled from years of studying experts at work, that capture what successful software designers actually do to create great software.<br /><br />The book presents these insights in a series of two-page illustrated spreads, with the principle and a short explanatory text on one page, and a drawing on the facing page. For example, "Experts generate alternatives" is illustrated by the same few balloons turned into a set of very different balloon animals. The text is engaging and accessible; the drawings are thought-provoking and often playful.<br /><br />Organized into such categories as "Experts reflect," "Experts are not afraid," and "Experts break the rules," the insights range from "Experts prefer simple solutions" to "Experts see error as opportunity." Readers learn that "Experts involve the user"; "Experts take inspiration from wherever they can"; "Experts design throughout the creation of software"; and "Experts draw the problem as much as they draw the solution."<br /><br />One habit for an aspiring expert software designer to develop would be to read and reread this entertaining but essential little book. The insights described offer a guide for the novice or a reference for the veteran--in software design or any design profession.<br /><br />A companion web site provides an annotated bibliography that compiles key underpinning literature, the opportunity to suggest additional insights, and more.',

    book_description:
      'There are many books about topics and disciplines in Information Technology. But most books concentrate on a single area. This book is an exception - it looks at three disciplines and ties them together. Excellent idea. Congratulations to Koray for putting this book together, and also for his generosity in donating profits to schools." <br /> -- Dorothy Graham, Best-selling Author <br /> "Koray does a great job of using clever, insightful metaphors to illustrate concepts. He writes in an accessible, easy-to-read style. I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did."<br /> -- Rex Black, Best-selling Author <br /> "In his book Koray uses two phrases again and again.

      "Get the best out of Node.js by mastering its most powerful components and patterns to create modular and scalable applications with ease<br /><br />Node.js is a massively popular software platform that lets you use JavaScript to easily create scalable server-side applications. It allows you to create efficient code, enabling a more sustainable way of writing software made of only one language across the full stack, along with extreme levels of reusability, pragmatism, simplicity, and collaboration. Node.js is revolutionizing the web and the way people and companies create their software.<br /><br />In this book, we will take you on a journey across various ideas and components, and the challenges you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software using the Node.js platform. You will also discover the \"Node.js way\" of dealing with design and coding decisions.<br /><br />The book kicks off by exploring the basics of Node.js describing it's asynchronous single-threaded architecture and the main design patterns. It then shows you how to master the asynchronous control flow patterns,and the stream component and it culminates into a detailed list of Node.js implementations of the most common design patterns as well as some specific design patterns that are exclusive to the Node.js world.Lastly, it dives into more advanced concepts such as Universal Javascript, and scalability' and it's meant to conclude the journey by giving the reader all the necessary concepts to be able to build an enterprise grade application using Node.js.",

    book_description:
      "The days of purely aesthetic design are long gone. Today's web designers are driven by pertinent questions like these: How will I win the battle of the short attention span? How do I put visitors at ease and provide the information they're consciously (and unconsciously) expecting? How will the design of my site encourage users to engage, browse, or buy? There's a body of tested psychological principles that can transform your digital designs by anticipating and benefiting from how human beings react to stimuli. This scientific approach to the decision making process, attitudes to risk and reward, group influence, and more are a treasure trove ready for you to apply to the field of website design.<br /><br />Design for the Mind: Seven Psychological Principles of Persuasive Design teaches web designers and developers how to create sites and applications that appeal to our innate natural responses as humans. Author Victor Yocco, a researcher on psychology and communication, introduces the most immediately relevant and applicable psychological concepts, breaks down each theory into easily-digested principles, then shows how they can be used to inform better design. The idea is not to produce a use-by-rote set of patterns for digital persuasion, but to deepen your understanding of why people react in the way they do to design features and approaches. After reading the book, you should be equipped to make your work more psychologically friendly, engaging, and persuasive.",

    book_description:
      '<b>Dataviz—the new language of business</b><br /><br />A good visualization can communicate the nature and potential impact of information and ideas more powerfully than any other form of communication.<br /><br />For a long time “dataviz” was left to specialists—data scientists and professional designers. No longer. A new generation of tools and massive amounts of available data make it easy for anyone to create visualizations that communicate ideas far more effectively than generic spreadsheet charts ever could.<br /><br />What’s more, building good charts is quickly becoming a need-to-have skill for managers. If you’re not doing it, other managers are, and they’re getting noticed for it and getting credit for contributing to your company’s success.<br /><br />In <i>Good Charts</i>, dataviz maven Scott Berinato provides an essential guide to how visualization works and how to use this new language to impress and persuade. Dataviz today is where spreadsheets and word processors were in the early 1980s—on the cusp of changing how we work. Berinato lays out a system for thinking visually and building better charts through a process of talking, sketching, and prototyping.<br /><br />This book is much more than a set of static rules for making visualizations. It taps into both well-established and cutting-edge research in visual perception and neuroscience, as well as the emerging field of visualization science, to explore why good charts (and bad ones) create “feelings behind our eyes.” Along the way, Berinato also includes many engaging vignettes of dataviz pros, illustrating the ideas in practice.<br /><br /><i>Good Charts</i> will help you turn plain, uninspiring charts that merely present information into smart, effective visualizations that powerfully convey ideas.<br />',

    book_description:
      'Lead transformation using speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols <br />Great leaders anticipate the future. But, the reality is that the vast majority of people fear the unknown. Most would rather stick with the status quo than go somewhere new, especially because they know change is hard and risky. According to Nancy Duarte, acclaimed author of "Resonate," and Patti Sanchez, a communications expert, change doesn t have to be so hard. <br />With the right communication tools, leaders can inspire others to long for a brighter future and move them to make it a reality. In their new book, "Illuminate," Duarte and Sanchez lay out a plan for leading people through the five stages of transformation using the persuasive power of speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols. <br />Any leader can learn how to create galvanizing moments that motivate people. This book will show you how to encourage people to embrace and execute bold plans by: <br /> Identifying which stage of the venture you\'re in and where to go next<br /> Empathizing with those who might resist and seeing the journey through their eyes<br /> Articulating what people need to hear (speeches and stories), do (ceremonies), and see (symbols) to long for your vision<br /> Commemorating milestones and accomplishments along the way. <br />"Illuminate" is packed with case studies of leaders who have used powerful communication to navigate transformation well, including IBM, Starbucks, Rackspace, Chick-fil-A, Apple, Interface, charity: water, and more. Mastering these effective communication tools you, too, will be able to confidently lead others into the future."',

      '<em>Building Your Next Big Thing with Google Cloud Platform</em> shows you how to take advantage of the Google Cloud Platform technologies to build all kinds of cloud-hosted software and services for both public and private consumption. Whether you need a simple virtual server to run your legacy application or you need to architect a sophisticated high-traffic web application, Cloud Platform provides all the tools and products required to create innovative applications and a robust infrastructure to manage them.<br /><br />Google is known for the scalability, reliability, and efficiency of its various online products, from Google Search to Gmail. And, the results are impressive. Google Search, for example, returns results literally within fractions of second. How is this possible? Google custom-builds both hardware and software, including servers, switches, networks, data centers, the operating system\'s stack, application frameworks, applications, and APIs.<br /><br />Have you ever imagined what you could build if you were able to tap the same infrastructure that Google uses to create and manage its products?<br /><br />Now you can! <em>Building Your Next Big Thing with Google Cloud Platform</em> shows you how to take advantage of the Google Cloud Platform technologies to build all kinds of cloud-hosted software and services for both public and private consumption. Whether you need a simple virtual server to run your legacy application or you need to architect a sophisticated high-traffic web application, Cloud Platform provides all the tools and products required to create innovative applications and a robust infrastructure to manage them.<br /><br />Using this book as your compass, you can navigate your way through the Google Cloud Platform and turn your ideas into reality. The authors, both Google Developer Experts in Google Cloud Platform, systematically introduce various Cloud Platform products one at a time and discuss their strengths and scenarios where they are a suitable fit. But rather than a manual-like "tell all" approach, the emphasis is on how to Get Things Done so that you get up to speed with Google Cloud Platform as quickly as possible. You will learn how to use the following technologies, among others:<br /><br /><br />Google Compute Engine<br />Google App Engine<br />Google Container Engine<br />Google App Engine Managed VMs<br />Google Cloud SQL<br />Google Cloud Storage<br />Google Cloud Datastore<br />Google BigQuery<br />Google Cloud Dataflow<br />Google Cloud DNS<br />Google Cloud Pub/Sub<br />Google Cloud Endpoints<br />Google Cloud Deployment Manager<br />Author on Google Cloud Platform<br />Google APIs and Translate API<br />Using real-world examples, the authors first walk you through the basics of cloud computing, cloud terminologies and public cloud services. Then they dive right into Google Cloud Platform and how you can use it to tackle your challenges, build new products, analyze big data, and much more. Whether you\'re an independent developer, startup, or Fortune 500 company, you have never had easier to access to world-class production, product development, and infrastructure tools. Google Cloud Platform is your ticket to leveraging your skills and knowledge into making reliable, scalable, and efficient products--just like how Google builds its own products.',

    book_description:
      "An algorithm is nothing more than a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. The algorithms you'll use most often as a programmer have already been discovered, tested, and proven. If you want to take a hard pass on Knuth's brilliant but impenetrable theories and the dense multi-page proofs you'll find in most textbooks, this is the book for you. This fully-illustrated and engaging guide makes it easy for you to learn how to use algorithms effectively in your own programs.<br /><br />Grokking Algorithms is a disarming take on a core computer science topic. In it, you'll learn how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face in day-to-day life as a programmer. You'll start with problems like sorting and searching. As you build up your skills in thinking algorithmically, you'll tackle more complex concerns such as data compression or artificial intelligence. Whether you're writing business software, video games, mobile apps, or system utilities, you'll learn algorithmic techniques for solving problems that you thought were out of your grasp. For example, you'll be able to:<br />Write a spell checker using graph algorithms<br />Understand how data compression works using Huffman coding<br />Identify problems that take too long to solve with naive algorithms, and attack them with algorithms that give you an approximate answer instead<br />Each carefully-presented example includes helpful diagrams and fully-annotated code samples in Python. By the end of this book, you will know some of the most widely applicable algorithms as well as how and when to use them.",

    book_description:
      'Awareness of design smells - indicators of common design problems - helps developers or software engineers understand mistakes made while designing, what design principles were overlooked or misapplied, and what principles need to be applied properly to address those smells through refactoring. Developers and software engineers may "know" principles and patterns, but are not aware of the "smells" that exist in their design because of wrong or mis-application of principles or patterns. These smells tend to contribute heavily to technical debt - further time owed to fix projects thought to be complete - and need to be addressed via proper refactoring.<br /><br /><i>Refactoring for Software Design Smells</i> presents 25 structural design smells, their role in identifying design issues, and potential refactoring solutions. Organized across common areas of software design, each smell is presented with diagrams and examples illustrating the poor design practices and the problems that result, creating a catalog of nuggets of readily usable information that developers or engineers can apply in their projects. The authors distill their research and experience as consultants and trainers, providing insights that have been used to improve refactoring and reduce the time and costs of managing software projects. Along the way they recount anecdotes from actual projects on which the relevant smell helped address a design issue.<br /><br /><br />Contains a comprehensive catalog of 25 structural design smells (organized around four fundamental design principles) that contribute to technical debt in software projects<br />Presents a unique naming scheme for smells that helps understand the cause of a smell as well as points toward its potential refactoring<br />Includes illustrative examples that showcase the poor design practices underlying a smell and the problems that result<br />Covers pragmatic techniques for refactoring design smells to manage technical debt and to create and maintain high-quality software in practice<br />Presents insightful anecdotes and case studies drawn from the trenches of real-world projects',

    book_description:
      '<b>How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?</b><br /><br />Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?<br />Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.<br /><br /><br /><i>Hooked</i> is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. <i>Hooked</i> is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.<br /><br /><br />Eyal provides readers with:<br /><br /><br />• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.<br />• Actionable steps for building products people love.<br /><br />• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.',

      "No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don't fully understand the language. This concise, in-depth guide takes you inside JavaScript's this structure and object prototypes. You'll learn how they work and why they're integral to behavior delegation--a design pattern in which objects are linked, rather than cloned.<br /><br />Like other books in the \"You Don't Know JS\" series, this and Object Prototypes dives into trickier parts of the language that many JavaScript programmers simply avoid. Armed with this knowledge, you can become a true JavaScript master.<br /><br />With this book you will:<br /><br /><br />Explore how the this binding points to objects based on how the function is called<br />Look into the nature of JS objects and why you'd need to point to them<br />Learn how developers use the mixin pattern to fake classes in JS<br />Examine how JS's prototype mechanism forms links between objects<br />Learn how to move from class/inheritance design to behavior delegation<br />Understand how the OLOO (objects-linked-to-other-objects) coding style naturally implements behavior delegation",

      'Introducing the practical and inspirational guide to incorporating Kaizen and its powerful principles into one\'s daily life. Rooted in the two thousand-year-old wisdom of the Tao Te Ching--"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"--Kaizen is the art of making great and lasting change through small, steady increments. Kaizen is the tortoise versus the hare. Kaizen is the eleven Fortune 500 companies that significantly outperformed the market through moderate, step-by-step actions. Kaizen is losing weight not by a crash diet (which more often than not crashes) but by eating one bite less at each meal--then, a month later, eating two bites less. Kaizen is starting a life-changing exercise program by standing--just standing--on a treadmill for one minute a day.<br /><br />Written by an expert on Kaizen--Dr. Robert Maurer, a psychologist on the staff at the UCLA medical school who speaks and consults nationally--<i>One Small Step</i> is the gentle but potent way to effect change. Beginning by outlining the all-important role that fear plays in all types of change--and Kaizen\'s ability to circumvent it--Dr. Maurer then explains the 7 Small Steps: how to Think Small Thoughts, Take Small Actions, Solve Small Problems, and more. He shows how to perform mind sculpture--visualizing virtual change so that real change comes more naturally. Why small rewards motivate better than big rewards. How great discoveries are made by paying attention to the little details most of us overlook. Hundreds of examples of Kaizen at work grace the book, as well as quotes from W. Edwards Deming (who brought Kaizen to Japanese industry), Peter Drucker, coach John Wooden, and others.',

      'No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don\'t fully understand the language. This concise yet in-depth guide takes you inside scope and closures, two core concepts you need to know to become a more efficient and effective JavaScript programmer. You\'ll learn how and why they work, and how an understanding of closures can be a powerful part of your development skillset.<br /><br />Like other books in the "You Don\'t Know JS" series, <i>Scope and Closures</i> dives into trickier parts of the language that many JavaScript programmers simply avoid. Armed with this knowledge, you can achieve true JavaScript mastery.<br /><br /><br />Learn about scope, a set of rules to help JavaScript engines locate variables in your code<br />Go deeper into nested scope, a series of containers for variables and functions<br />Explore function- and block-based scope, "hoisting", and the patterns and benefits of scope-based hiding<br />Discover how to use closures for synchronous and asynchronous tasks, including the creation of JavaScript libraries',

      "Although object orientated programming is probably not the first thing that programmers think of when they think of JavaScript, JavaScript is not just object-oriented but also incredibly powerful and expressive, putting many design decisions in the hands of those developers who know how to use it effectively. <i>Object-Oriented JavaScript</i> helps experienced programmers understand JavaScript's unique approach to object-oriented programming so they can tackle their problems effectively, and with less code. Author Nicholas Zakas provides even readers with minimal JavaScript experience a deep understanding of the structure of the language.",

    book_description:
      'Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.<br /><br />In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> is a powerful primer on how—and why—some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.<br />',

      '<b>The Key to Effective Communication</b><br /><br />Communication is essential in a healthy organization. But all too often when we interact with people—especially those who report to us—we simply tell them what we think they need to know. This shuts them down. To generate bold new ideas, to avoid disastrous mistakes, to develop agility and flexibility, we need to practice Humble Inquiry.<br /><br />Ed Schein defines Humble Inquiry as “the fine art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person.” In this seminal work, Schein contrasts Humble Inquiry with other kinds of inquiry, shows the benefits Humble Inquiry provides in many different settings, and offers advice on overcoming the cultural, organizational, and psychological barriers that keep us from practicing it.',

      '<b>Completely revised and updated, this best-selling introduction to programming in JavaScript focuses on writing real applications.</b><br /><br /><i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> dives into the JavaScript language to show programmers how to write elegant, effective JavaScript code. Like any good programming book, <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> begins with fundamentals--variables, control structures, functions, and data structures--then moves on to complex topics like object-oriented programming and regular expressions. This third edition introduces new features covering the 2017 version of JavaScript, such as class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and black scope. Author Marijn Haverbeke keeps the friendly tone and easy-to-follow explanations that made the original a hit, and he adds new exercises for readers to test their skills. <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> will have readers fluent in the language of the web in no time, eloquently.',

    book_description:
      'Are you ready to create your own "good charts"--data visualizations that more effectively communicate your ideas and research and that advance your career? The original <i>Good Charts</i> has changed the dataviz and management landscape by helping readers understand how to think visually, and by laying out a process for creating powerful data visualizations.<br /><br />Since its publication, the market has consistently demanded more practical content and tools to help people in all kinds of enterprises gain the skills they need to get started. The <i>Good Charts Workbook</i> extends the usefulness of <i>Good Charts</i> by putting theory into practice and helping readers to apply its principles.<br /><br />Author, HBR editor, and dataviz expert Scott Berinato leads you, step-by-step, through several example datasets and basic charts, providing space for users to practice the <i>Good Charts</i> talk-sketch-prototype process for improving those charts. Users are prompted at each step with reminders and hints about how to proceed. Examples will include a "Discussion Key" showing how to approach the challenge and why. Each challenge focuses on a different, common visualization problem such as simplification, storytelling, creating conceptual charts, and many others.<br /><br /><i>Good Charts Workbook</i> is the must-have complement to <i>Good Charts</i>, helping you become more sophisticated in understanding the dataviz around you and more effective in using dataviz to make your case.',

    book_description:
      '<b>Node.js</b> Guidebook aims to introduce readers to the world of Node.js. Node.js is an open source JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript on server-side. Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.<b>Contents</b>Introduction to Node.js, Modules in MNode.js, File System Module, NPM in Node, Event Handling in Node.js, More on Modules, Node.js with My SQL, Express and Node .Js',

    book_description:
      "In this book, you'll find 54 hands-on descriptions that help you DO the key methods used in service design. These methods include instructions, guidelines, and tips-and-tricks for activities within research, ideation, prototyping, and facilitation. This is the print version of the method companion to the book <i>This Is Service Design Doing</i> (#TiSDD). It includes the same content that you can find free on the book website, tisdd.com, but nicely revisualized and presented in a professional bound format.<br /><br />Caveat: While methods are the building blocks of a service design process, owning a pile of bricks does not make you an architect or even a bricklayer. Success in doing service design certainly requires a mastery of these methods. However, you must also be able to combine them into a process that fits the context and needs of your organization and guide people through this new way of working.<br /><br />This book only contains the building blocks--the methods. It doesn't detail how to assemble them into a cohesive design process or how to plan or manage it. Neither does it describe why people should invest in service design nor explain how to bring service design to life in your organization. For all of this (and more), please read <i>This Is Service Design Doing</i>.",

    book_description:
      '<p><em>What “<strong>Kubernetes” </strong>does and how?</em></p><p>After working in the technology and consulting ecosystem for the last 10 years, I am a huge supporter of simplification. While I understood the whole concept of Containerization and automating the deployment, I wanted to explain the bunch of newly recruited Technology Consultants in our team that how actually it’s used and deployed.</p><p>So, the logical topics to be explained with examples were:</p>  The Background of it? Why we needed this system in first place? \n   How Kubernetes Operates? The Nuts and Bolts of the system. \n   How it is deployed? \n   Best Practices \n <p>If these things are clear with examples then we can operate with confidence and manage the project well.</p><p>So, here it is. All our discussions are formulated in a book to help you people to take your respective agenda ahead in your current role with conviction. The book has been written in a simple, easy to comprehend language and can be used by Non-Programmers, Project Managers, Business Consultants or any other persons with an interest in Kubernetes.</p><p>So, move ahead with your Continuous Development journey with this new book and as I mentioned earlier: <strong><em>let’s simplify the discussions around!</em></strong></p>',

    book_description:
      "In this book, the CEO of Cazton, Inc. and internationally-acclaimed speaker, <b>Chander Dhall</b>, demonstrates current website design scalability patterns and takes a pragmatic approach to explaining their pros and cons to show you how to select the appropriate pattern for your site. He then tests the patterns by deliberately forcing them to fail and exposing potential flaws before discussing how to design the optimal pattern to match your scale requirements. The author explains the use of polyglot programming and how to match the right patterns to your business needs. He also details several No-SQL patterns and explains the fundamentals of different paradigms of No-SQL by showing complementary strategies of using them along with relational databases to achieve the best results. He also teaches how to make the scalability pattern work with a real-world microservices pattern. <br />With the proliferation of countless electronic devices and the ever growing number of Internet users, the scalability of websites has become an increasingly important challenge. Scalability, even though highly coveted, may not be so easy to achieve. Think that you can't attain responsiveness along with scalability? Chander Dhall will demonstrate that, in fact, they go hand in hand.<br /><b>What You'll Learn</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Architect and develop applications so that they are easy to scale. <br /><br /><br />Learn different scaling and partitioning options and the combinations. <br /><br /><br />Learn techniques to speed up responsiveness. <br /><br /><br />Deep dive into caching, column-family databases, document databases, search engines and RDBMS. <br /><br /><br />Learn scalability and responsiveness concepts that are usually ignored.<br /><br /><br />Effectively balance scalability, performance, responsiveness, and availability while minimizing downtime.<br /><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br /><br />Executives (CXOs), software architects, developers, and IT Pros<br />",

    book_description:
      "Manage and understand the full capabilities of successful REST development. REST API development is a hot topic in the programming world, but not many resources exist for developers to really understand how you can leverage the advantages.<br /><br />This completely updated second edition provides a brief background on REST and the tools it provides (well known and not so well known), then explains how there is more to REST than just JSON and URLs. You will learn about the maintained modules currently available in the npm community, including Express, Restify, Vatican, and Swagger. Finally you will code an example API from start to finish, using a subset of the tools covered.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Node community is currently flooded with modules; some of them are published once and never updated again - cluttering the entire universe of packages. <em>Pro REST API Development with Node.js</em> shines light into that black hole of modules for the developers trying to create an API. Understand REST API development with Node.js using this book today.<br /><br /><b>What You'll Learn</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Understand how REST and API development mix up with Node.js<br /><br /><br />Create a scalable, technology agnostic, and uniform interface<br />Prepare your services to be consumed by your clients<br /><br /><br />Test and deploy your API<br /><br /><br />Review troubleshooting techniques<br /><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br /><br /><br />Any Node.js developer who wants to fully understand REST API development. <br />Beginner and Intermediate Node.js developers who are looking to fully understand how to create RESTful microservices.",

    book_description:
      'A comprehensive introduction to designing services according to the needs of the customer or participants, this book addresses a new and emerging field of design and the disciplines that feed and result from it.<br /><br />Despite its intrinsic multidisciplinarity, service design is a new specialization of design in its own right. Responding to the challenges of and providing holisitic, creative and innovative solutions to increasingly complex contemporary societies, service design now represents an integrative and advanced culture of design. All over the world new design studios are defining their practice as service design while long established design and innovation consultancies are increasingly embracing service design as a key capacity within their offering.<br /><br />Divided into two parts to allow for specific reader requirements, <i>Service Design</i> starts by focusing on main service design concepts and critical aspects. Part II offers a methodological overview and practical tools for the service design learner, and highlights fundamental capacities the service design student must master. Combined with a number of interviews and case studies from leading service designers, this is a comprehensive, informative exploration of this exciting new area of design.',

    book_description:
      "Key Features   Implement common data structures and the associated algorithms, as well as the context in which they are used. \n   Master existing JavaScript data structures such as array, set and map and learn how to implement new ones such as stacks, linked lists, trees and graphs in ES 8. \n   Develop abstract data types to extend JavaScript into a more flexible and powerful programming language \n  Book Description <p>A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer to utilize resources efficiently. Data structures and algorithms are the base of every solution to any programming problem. With this book you will learn to write complex and powerful code using the latest ES 8 features.</p><p>This book begins by covering basics of the JavaScript language and introducing ECMAScript 8, before gradually moving on to the most important data structures such as array, queue, stack, and linked list. You will gain an in-depth knowledge of how hash tables and set data structure functions, as well as how trees and hash maps can be used to search files in a HD or represent a database. This book is an accessible route deeper into JavaScript. Graphs being one of the most complex data structures you’ll encounter, we’ll also give you a better understanding of why and how graphs are largely used in GPS navigation systems in social networks.</p><p>Toward the end of the book, you’ll discover how all the theories presented by this book can be applied in real-world solutions while working on your own computer networks and Facebook searches.</p> What you will learn   Declare, initialize, add, and remove items from array, stack, and queue. \n   Create and use linked lists, doubly linked lists and circular linked lists. \n   Store unique elements with hash table, dictionaries, and set. \n   Use the binary tree and binary search tree. \n   Get the knack of using algorithms such as DFS (Depth-first Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) for the most complex data structures \n   Sort data structures using a range of algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort. \n   Search elements in data structures using sequential sort and binary search. \n  About the Author <p><b>Loiane Groner</b> has over 10 years of experience in developing enterprise applications. She has worked at multinational companies, such as IBM, and nowadays she works as Software Development Manager at a financial institution, where she manages overseas solutions. Her areas of expertise include Java, Sencha technologies (Ext JS), and hybrid mobile development with PhoneGap and Ionic.</p><p>She is passionate about technology, and she has dedicated herself to spreading knowledge in the software development community through her blog, as a guest speaker in IT conferences, and also as a guest professor in university extension courses.</p><p>While at university, she worked as teacher's assistant for 2 years for the Algorithms, Data Structures, and Computing Theory classes. She represented her university at the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest – Brazilian Finals (South America Regionals) and also worked as Student Delegate of SBC (Brazilian Computing Society). She won a merit award in her Senior year for being one of top three students with better GPAs in the Computer Science department and has also graduated with honors.</p><p>Loiane is also the author of the books Ext JS 4 First Look, Mastering Ext JS, Mastering Ext JS - Second Edition, Sencha Architect App Development, Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms, and JavaScript </p>",

    book_description:
      "For digital content to deliver on its potential, it must be easy to find, shareable, and available for all channels and devices. This requires careful upfront attention to back-end content strategy and its linkages with design and development. However, back-end content strategy is an emerging and complex area of practice with few useful resources for practitioners, and many organizations are struggling to deal with soaring amounts of content. In <b>Designing Future-Friendly Content</b>, Mike Atherton and Carrie Hane introduce a comprehensive, up-to-date content strategy process that starts outside the interface, using research and modeling to build a shared map of a subject before a single pixel is drawn. Their content-first approach helps you reuse and remix valuable assets both for today's needs and tomorrow's opportunities, as you master the interplay of content strategy, design, and management, and smoothly orchestrate your entire content team. Throughout, this practical and conversational guide demonstrates key concepts through case study examples and illustrations. You'll learn how to:<br />Model subject domains and use your models to plan web content Research and model content and use the results to inform UI and CMS design Plan for an effective CMS implementation Clarify the roles of designers, developers, and content strategists, and build cross-functional teams that work together well Tackle content overload, growing device diversity, fast-changing design trends, siloed content creation, and other key challenges",

      'Functional-Light JavaScript is a balanced, pragmatic exploration of Functional Programming in JavaScript. <br /><br />Functional Programming (FP) is an incredibly powerful paradigm for structuring code that yields more robust, verifiable, and readable programs. If you\'ve ever tried to learn FP but struggled with terms like "monad", mathematical concepts like category theory, or symbols like λ, you\'re not alone. <br /><br />Functional-Light programming distills the most vital aspects of FP—function purity, value immutability, composition, and more!—down to approachable JavaScript patterns. Rather than the all-or-nothing dogmatism often encountered in FP, this book teaches you how to improve your programs line by line.',

      "Learn the psychological constrictions of attention, perception, memory, disposition, motivation, and social influence that determine whether customers will be receptive to your digital innovations.<br /><br />Bottlenecks: Aligning UX Design with User Psychology fills a need for entrepreneurs, designers, and marketing professionals in the application of foundational psychology to user-experience design. The first generation of books on the topic focused on web pages and cognitive psychology. This book covers apps, social media, in-car infotainment, and multiplayer video games, and it explores the crucial roles played by behaviorism, development, personality, and social psychology. Author David Evans is an experimental psychology Ph.D. and senior manager of consumer research at Microsoft who recounts high-stakes case studies in which behavioral theory aligned digital designs with the bottlenecks in human nature to the benefit of users and businesses alike.<br /><br />Innovators in design and students of psychology will learn:<br /><br />The psychological processes determining users' perception of, engagement with, and recommendation of digital innovations<br /><br />Examples of interfaces before and after simple psychological alignments that vastly enhanced their effectiveness<br /><br />Strategies for marketing and product development in an age of social media and behavioral targeting<br /><br />Hypotheses for research that both academics and enterprises can perform to better meet users' needs<br /><br />Who This Book Is For<br /><br />Designers and entrepreneurs will use this book to give their innovations an edge on what are increasingly competitive platforms such as apps, bots, in-car apps, augmented reality content. Usability researchers and market researchers will leverage it to enhance their consulting and reporting. Students and lecturers in psychology departments will want it to help land employment in the private sector.",

      'Building upon the success of best-sellers The Clean Coder and Clean Code, legendary software craftsman Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin shows how to bring greater professionalism and discipline to application architecture and design.<br />As with his other books, Martin\'s Clean Architecture doesn\'t merely present multiple choices and options, and say "use your best judgment": it tells you what choices to make, and why those choices are critical to your success. Martin offers direct, no-nonsense answers to key architecture and design questions like:<br /><br />What are the best high level structures for different kinds of applications, including web, database, thick-client, console, and embedded apps?<br /><br />What are the core principles of software architecture?<br /><br />What is the role of the architect, and what is he/she really trying to achieve?<br /><br />What are the core principles of software design?<br /><br />How do designs and architectures go wrong, and what can you do about it?<br /><br />What are the disciplines and practices of professional architects and designers?<br /><br />Clean Architecture is essential reading for every software architect, systems analyst, system designer, and software manager -- and for any programmer who aspires to these roles or is impacted by their work.',

    book_description:
      '<b>An engaging, illustrated collection of insights revealing the practices and principles that expert software designers use to create great software.</b><br /><br />What makes an expert software designer? It is more than experience or innate ability. Expert software designers have specific habits, learned practices, and observed principles that they apply deliberately during their design work. This book offers sixty-six insights, distilled from years of studying experts at work, that capture what successful software designers actually do to create great software.<br /><br />The book presents these insights in a series of two-page illustrated spreads, with the principle and a short explanatory text on one page, and a drawing on the facing page. For example, "Experts generate alternatives" is illustrated by the same few balloons turned into a set of very different balloon animals. The text is engaging and accessible; the drawings are thought-provoking and often playful.<br /><br />Organized into such categories as "Experts reflect," "Experts are not afraid," and "Experts break the rules," the insights range from "Experts prefer simple solutions" to "Experts see error as opportunity." Readers learn that "Experts involve the user"; "Experts take inspiration from wherever they can"; "Experts design throughout the creation of software"; and "Experts draw the problem as much as they draw the solution."<br /><br />One habit for an aspiring expert software designer to develop would be to read and reread this entertaining but essential little book. The insights described offer a guide for the novice or a reference for the veteran--in software design or any design profession.<br /><br />A companion web site provides an annotated bibliography that compiles key underpinning literature, the opportunity to suggest additional insights, and more.',

    book_description:
      'There are many books about topics and disciplines in Information Technology. But most books concentrate on a single area. This book is an exception - it looks at three disciplines and ties them together. Excellent idea. Congratulations to Koray for putting this book together, and also for his generosity in donating profits to schools." <br /> -- Dorothy Graham, Best-selling Author <br /> "Koray does a great job of using clever, insightful metaphors to illustrate concepts. He writes in an accessible, easy-to-read style. I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did."<br /> -- Rex Black, Best-selling Author <br /> "In his book Koray uses two phrases again and again.

      "Get the best out of Node.js by mastering its most powerful components and patterns to create modular and scalable applications with ease<br /><br />Node.js is a massively popular software platform that lets you use JavaScript to easily create scalable server-side applications. It allows you to create efficient code, enabling a more sustainable way of writing software made of only one language across the full stack, along with extreme levels of reusability, pragmatism, simplicity, and collaboration. Node.js is revolutionizing the web and the way people and companies create their software.<br /><br />In this book, we will take you on a journey across various ideas and components, and the challenges you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software using the Node.js platform. You will also discover the \"Node.js way\" of dealing with design and coding decisions.<br /><br />The book kicks off by exploring the basics of Node.js describing it's asynchronous single-threaded architecture and the main design patterns. It then shows you how to master the asynchronous control flow patterns,and the stream component and it culminates into a detailed list of Node.js implementations of the most common design patterns as well as some specific design patterns that are exclusive to the Node.js world.Lastly, it dives into more advanced concepts such as Universal Javascript, and scalability' and it's meant to conclude the journey by giving the reader all the necessary concepts to be able to build an enterprise grade application using Node.js.",

    book_description:
      "The days of purely aesthetic design are long gone. Today's web designers are driven by pertinent questions like these: How will I win the battle of the short attention span? How do I put visitors at ease and provide the information they're consciously (and unconsciously) expecting? How will the design of my site encourage users to engage, browse, or buy? There's a body of tested psychological principles that can transform your digital designs by anticipating and benefiting from how human beings react to stimuli. This scientific approach to the decision making process, attitudes to risk and reward, group influence, and more are a treasure trove ready for you to apply to the field of website design.<br /><br />Design for the Mind: Seven Psychological Principles of Persuasive Design teaches web designers and developers how to create sites and applications that appeal to our innate natural responses as humans. Author Victor Yocco, a researcher on psychology and communication, introduces the most immediately relevant and applicable psychological concepts, breaks down each theory into easily-digested principles, then shows how they can be used to inform better design. The idea is not to produce a use-by-rote set of patterns for digital persuasion, but to deepen your understanding of why people react in the way they do to design features and approaches. After reading the book, you should be equipped to make your work more psychologically friendly, engaging, and persuasive.",

    book_description:
      '<b>Dataviz—the new language of business</b><br /><br />A good visualization can communicate the nature and potential impact of information and ideas more powerfully than any other form of communication.<br /><br />For a long time “dataviz” was left to specialists—data scientists and professional designers. No longer. A new generation of tools and massive amounts of available data make it easy for anyone to create visualizations that communicate ideas far more effectively than generic spreadsheet charts ever could.<br /><br />What’s more, building good charts is quickly becoming a need-to-have skill for managers. If you’re not doing it, other managers are, and they’re getting noticed for it and getting credit for contributing to your company’s success.<br /><br />In <i>Good Charts</i>, dataviz maven Scott Berinato provides an essential guide to how visualization works and how to use this new language to impress and persuade. Dataviz today is where spreadsheets and word processors were in the early 1980s—on the cusp of changing how we work. Berinato lays out a system for thinking visually and building better charts through a process of talking, sketching, and prototyping.<br /><br />This book is much more than a set of static rules for making visualizations. It taps into both well-established and cutting-edge research in visual perception and neuroscience, as well as the emerging field of visualization science, to explore why good charts (and bad ones) create “feelings behind our eyes.” Along the way, Berinato also includes many engaging vignettes of dataviz pros, illustrating the ideas in practice.<br /><br /><i>Good Charts</i> will help you turn plain, uninspiring charts that merely present information into smart, effective visualizations that powerfully convey ideas.<br />',

    book_description:
      'Lead transformation using speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols <br />Great leaders anticipate the future. But, the reality is that the vast majority of people fear the unknown. Most would rather stick with the status quo than go somewhere new, especially because they know change is hard and risky. According to Nancy Duarte, acclaimed author of "Resonate," and Patti Sanchez, a communications expert, change doesn t have to be so hard. <br />With the right communication tools, leaders can inspire others to long for a brighter future and move them to make it a reality. In their new book, "Illuminate," Duarte and Sanchez lay out a plan for leading people through the five stages of transformation using the persuasive power of speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols. <br />Any leader can learn how to create galvanizing moments that motivate people. This book will show you how to encourage people to embrace and execute bold plans by: <br /> Identifying which stage of the venture you\'re in and where to go next<br /> Empathizing with those who might resist and seeing the journey through their eyes<br /> Articulating what people need to hear (speeches and stories), do (ceremonies), and see (symbols) to long for your vision<br /> Commemorating milestones and accomplishments along the way. <br />"Illuminate" is packed with case studies of leaders who have used powerful communication to navigate transformation well, including IBM, Starbucks, Rackspace, Chick-fil-A, Apple, Interface, charity: water, and more. Mastering these effective communication tools you, too, will be able to confidently lead others into the future."',

      '<em>Building Your Next Big Thing with Google Cloud Platform</em> shows you how to take advantage of the Google Cloud Platform technologies to build all kinds of cloud-hosted software and services for both public and private consumption. Whether you need a simple virtual server to run your legacy application or you need to architect a sophisticated high-traffic web application, Cloud Platform provides all the tools and products required to create innovative applications and a robust infrastructure to manage them.<br /><br />Google is known for the scalability, reliability, and efficiency of its various online products, from Google Search to Gmail. And, the results are impressive. Google Search, for example, returns results literally within fractions of second. How is this possible? Google custom-builds both hardware and software, including servers, switches, networks, data centers, the operating system\'s stack, application frameworks, applications, and APIs.<br /><br />Have you ever imagined what you could build if you were able to tap the same infrastructure that Google uses to create and manage its products?<br /><br />Now you can! <em>Building Your Next Big Thing with Google Cloud Platform</em> shows you how to take advantage of the Google Cloud Platform technologies to build all kinds of cloud-hosted software and services for both public and private consumption. Whether you need a simple virtual server to run your legacy application or you need to architect a sophisticated high-traffic web application, Cloud Platform provides all the tools and products required to create innovative applications and a robust infrastructure to manage them.<br /><br />Using this book as your compass, you can navigate your way through the Google Cloud Platform and turn your ideas into reality. The authors, both Google Developer Experts in Google Cloud Platform, systematically introduce various Cloud Platform products one at a time and discuss their strengths and scenarios where they are a suitable fit. But rather than a manual-like "tell all" approach, the emphasis is on how to Get Things Done so that you get up to speed with Google Cloud Platform as quickly as possible. You will learn how to use the following technologies, among others:<br /><br /><br />Google Compute Engine<br />Google App Engine<br />Google Container Engine<br />Google App Engine Managed VMs<br />Google Cloud SQL<br />Google Cloud Storage<br />Google Cloud Datastore<br />Google BigQuery<br />Google Cloud Dataflow<br />Google Cloud DNS<br />Google Cloud Pub/Sub<br />Google Cloud Endpoints<br />Google Cloud Deployment Manager<br />Author on Google Cloud Platform<br />Google APIs and Translate API<br />Using real-world examples, the authors first walk you through the basics of cloud computing, cloud terminologies and public cloud services. Then they dive right into Google Cloud Platform and how you can use it to tackle your challenges, build new products, analyze big data, and much more. Whether you\'re an independent developer, startup, or Fortune 500 company, you have never had easier to access to world-class production, product development, and infrastructure tools. Google Cloud Platform is your ticket to leveraging your skills and knowledge into making reliable, scalable, and efficient products--just like how Google builds its own products.',

    book_description:
      "An algorithm is nothing more than a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. The algorithms you'll use most often as a programmer have already been discovered, tested, and proven. If you want to take a hard pass on Knuth's brilliant but impenetrable theories and the dense multi-page proofs you'll find in most textbooks, this is the book for you. This fully-illustrated and engaging guide makes it easy for you to learn how to use algorithms effectively in your own programs.<br /><br />Grokking Algorithms is a disarming take on a core computer science topic. In it, you'll learn how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face in day-to-day life as a programmer. You'll start with problems like sorting and searching. As you build up your skills in thinking algorithmically, you'll tackle more complex concerns such as data compression or artificial intelligence. Whether you're writing business software, video games, mobile apps, or system utilities, you'll learn algorithmic techniques for solving problems that you thought were out of your grasp. For example, you'll be able to:<br />Write a spell checker using graph algorithms<br />Understand how data compression works using Huffman coding<br />Identify problems that take too long to solve with naive algorithms, and attack them with algorithms that give you an approximate answer instead<br />Each carefully-presented example includes helpful diagrams and fully-annotated code samples in Python. By the end of this book, you will know some of the most widely applicable algorithms as well as how and when to use them.",

    book_description:
      'Awareness of design smells - indicators of common design problems - helps developers or software engineers understand mistakes made while designing, what design principles were overlooked or misapplied, and what principles need to be applied properly to address those smells through refactoring. Developers and software engineers may "know" principles and patterns, but are not aware of the "smells" that exist in their design because of wrong or mis-application of principles or patterns. These smells tend to contribute heavily to technical debt - further time owed to fix projects thought to be complete - and need to be addressed via proper refactoring.<br /><br /><i>Refactoring for Software Design Smells</i> presents 25 structural design smells, their role in identifying design issues, and potential refactoring solutions. Organized across common areas of software design, each smell is presented with diagrams and examples illustrating the poor design practices and the problems that result, creating a catalog of nuggets of readily usable information that developers or engineers can apply in their projects. The authors distill their research and experience as consultants and trainers, providing insights that have been used to improve refactoring and reduce the time and costs of managing software projects. Along the way they recount anecdotes from actual projects on which the relevant smell helped address a design issue.<br /><br /><br />Contains a comprehensive catalog of 25 structural design smells (organized around four fundamental design principles) that contribute to technical debt in software projects<br />Presents a unique naming scheme for smells that helps understand the cause of a smell as well as points toward its potential refactoring<br />Includes illustrative examples that showcase the poor design practices underlying a smell and the problems that result<br />Covers pragmatic techniques for refactoring design smells to manage technical debt and to create and maintain high-quality software in practice<br />Presents insightful anecdotes and case studies drawn from the trenches of real-world projects',

    book_description:
      '<b>How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?</b><br /><br />Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?<br />Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.<br /><br /><br /><i>Hooked</i> is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. <i>Hooked</i> is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.<br /><br /><br />Eyal provides readers with:<br /><br /><br />• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.<br />• Actionable steps for building products people love.<br /><br />• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.',

      "No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don't fully understand the language. This concise, in-depth guide takes you inside JavaScript's this structure and object prototypes. You'll learn how they work and why they're integral to behavior delegation--a design pattern in which objects are linked, rather than cloned.<br /><br />Like other books in the \"You Don't Know JS\" series, this and Object Prototypes dives into trickier parts of the language that many JavaScript programmers simply avoid. Armed with this knowledge, you can become a true JavaScript master.<br /><br />With this book you will:<br /><br /><br />Explore how the this binding points to objects based on how the function is called<br />Look into the nature of JS objects and why you'd need to point to them<br />Learn how developers use the mixin pattern to fake classes in JS<br />Examine how JS's prototype mechanism forms links between objects<br />Learn how to move from class/inheritance design to behavior delegation<br />Understand how the OLOO (objects-linked-to-other-objects) coding style naturally implements behavior delegation",

      'Introducing the practical and inspirational guide to incorporating Kaizen and its powerful principles into one\'s daily life. Rooted in the two thousand-year-old wisdom of the Tao Te Ching--"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"--Kaizen is the art of making great and lasting change through small, steady increments. Kaizen is the tortoise versus the hare. Kaizen is the eleven Fortune 500 companies that significantly outperformed the market through moderate, step-by-step actions. Kaizen is losing weight not by a crash diet (which more often than not crashes) but by eating one bite less at each meal--then, a month later, eating two bites less. Kaizen is starting a life-changing exercise program by standing--just standing--on a treadmill for one minute a day.<br /><br />Written by an expert on Kaizen--Dr. Robert Maurer, a psychologist on the staff at the UCLA medical school who speaks and consults nationally--<i>One Small Step</i> is the gentle but potent way to effect change. Beginning by outlining the all-important role that fear plays in all types of change--and Kaizen\'s ability to circumvent it--Dr. Maurer then explains the 7 Small Steps: how to Think Small Thoughts, Take Small Actions, Solve Small Problems, and more. He shows how to perform mind sculpture--visualizing virtual change so that real change comes more naturally. Why small rewards motivate better than big rewards. How great discoveries are made by paying attention to the little details most of us overlook. Hundreds of examples of Kaizen at work grace the book, as well as quotes from W. Edwards Deming (who brought Kaizen to Japanese industry), Peter Drucker, coach John Wooden, and others.',

      'No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don\'t fully understand the language. This concise yet in-depth guide takes you inside scope and closures, two core concepts you need to know to become a more efficient and effective JavaScript programmer. You\'ll learn how and why they work, and how an understanding of closures can be a powerful part of your development skillset.<br /><br />Like other books in the "You Don\'t Know JS" series, <i>Scope and Closures</i> dives into trickier parts of the language that many JavaScript programmers simply avoid. Armed with this knowledge, you can achieve true JavaScript mastery.<br /><br /><br />Learn about scope, a set of rules to help JavaScript engines locate variables in your code<br />Go deeper into nested scope, a series of containers for variables and functions<br />Explore function- and block-based scope, "hoisting", and the patterns and benefits of scope-based hiding<br />Discover how to use closures for synchronous and asynchronous tasks, including the creation of JavaScript libraries',

      "Although object orientated programming is probably not the first thing that programmers think of when they think of JavaScript, JavaScript is not just object-oriented but also incredibly powerful and expressive, putting many design decisions in the hands of those developers who know how to use it effectively. <i>Object-Oriented JavaScript</i> helps experienced programmers understand JavaScript's unique approach to object-oriented programming so they can tackle their problems effectively, and with less code. Author Nicholas Zakas provides even readers with minimal JavaScript experience a deep understanding of the structure of the language.",

    book_description:
      'Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.<br /><br />In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> is a powerful primer on how—and why—some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.<br />',

      '<b>The Key to Effective Communication</b><br /><br />Communication is essential in a healthy organization. But all too often when we interact with people—especially those who report to us—we simply tell them what we think they need to know. This shuts them down. To generate bold new ideas, to avoid disastrous mistakes, to develop agility and flexibility, we need to practice Humble Inquiry.<br /><br />Ed Schein defines Humble Inquiry as “the fine art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person.” In this seminal work, Schein contrasts Humble Inquiry with other kinds of inquiry, shows the benefits Humble Inquiry provides in many different settings, and offers advice on overcoming the cultural, organizational, and psychological barriers that keep us from practicing it.',
