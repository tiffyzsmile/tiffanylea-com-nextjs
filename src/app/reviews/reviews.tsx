          Tiffany is one of the most hardworking and talented engineers with
          whom I‚Äôve had the privilege to work with. Her flawless execution
          illustrates her expertise, exceptional technical skills, and work
          ethic. She continuously seeks to improve her craft to make things
          better, more efficient, and more effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tiffany‚Äôs problem-solving skills are one of her greatest strengths as
          she is always going the extra mile to make sure our customers have the
          best experience possible. As a product designer, her customer-centric
          engineering approach and design eye make Tiffany a dream to
          collaborate with. Her attention to detail is unparalleled and I was
          fortunate to experience it firsthand with her design system work.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is a true team player, always dropping her priorities to lend
          helping hands where needed and doing so with a smile. Tiffany would be
          a valuable addition to any team/company and I only pray our paths will
          cross again in the future!

          Tiffany and I (as the dedicated designer on the system) worked
          together on the Margarita Design System at Quantum Metric. We worked
          together to set solid foundations for building a scalable system which
          included road mapping and strategy, system evangelization, designing
          system structure, designing a doc site, and publishing/maintaining
          styles and components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without Tiffany‚Äôs well-informed technical expertise on the subject,
          her thoughtful, methodical, and system-oriented way of working, and
          dedication to ‚Äúdoing things the right the first time,‚Äù our system
          would not be in the amazing position it is today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tight-knit engineering/design relationships are so important to system
          work, and luckily Tiffany is a delight to work with! She‚Äôs kind,
          understanding, easy to communicate with, and has an infectiously
          positive outlook on what is possible for the future of whatever she is
          working on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though she is an (awesome) engineer, that doesn‚Äôt stop her from
          caring deeply about the designers experience using the system, and her
          aptitude for strategy development were a game-changer for our systems
          team.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has an understanding of IA and design that makes the collaborative
          work required much more efficient, and is always happy to provide
          designer-friendly explanations of relevant technical issues. She
          provided all the context a designer might not have in a way that not
          only allowed me to design our system more thoughtfully, but was
          instrumental in helping me develop better strategies for my system
          design work overall.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, any Design Systems team (or any team for that matter)
          would be leveled up with Tiffany on board. Hopefully we will work
          together in the future, and any team that picks her up will be making
          a smart decision!

          She can see a problem from a high-level business-value to the gritty
          technical details in the UI and uses this insight to give clear
          actionable feedback. She cuts right through to the heart of any issue
          and with her in meetings; they went faster, were clearer to everyone
          in the room, and were more likely to have actions to resolve issues
          rather than more meetings.

        <p>
          Her grasp of both her team‚Äôs technical and emotional status impressed
          me and is a sign of a great team leader. She always knew exactly where

          to various team members well.
